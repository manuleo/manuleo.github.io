      <p style="font-size: 20pt; text-align: center; padding-top: 10pt; padding-bottom: 15pt;">Exactly what we figured too! So we got down to work.</p>
      
      <div style="font-size:18pt; font-weight: 300;">
        Despite recent technological improvements, there is still a large share of starving people on this globe. 
        The aim of this project is to propose a way to end starvation in Africa, one of the continents most affected by this hunger issue. To do so, weâ€™ll devise an appropriate daily nutritional input with the goal of determining a set of food products. 
        To this end, a dataset of the <i> Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO) </i> was used as a primary resource of information. It contains material about agricultural production amounts, producer prices and a lot of other useful details to determine which countries should provide
        which food items, and is therefore at the heart of this project. 
        <br>
        <p><b>Our final goal:</b> 
          <br>
          Coming up with a possibility on how to redistribute food while minimizing the overall effort and costs.
        Ever since the dawn of civilization, 
        the African continent was riddled by chronic food shortages and famines. With growing affluence in recent years, the European 
        subcontinent on the other hand has experienced resource abundance. As a consequence, society's awareness for the dilemma of 
        food waste has significantly increased. However, specific proposals on solutions are rare and often too optimistic. 
        So why not use Data Science to solve it? </p>
